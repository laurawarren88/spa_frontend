# **Book Review Website** 💻

## ⭐️ Overview

This repository is the frontend for a media review application for books. It is a single page application, it uses:

```text
🔹 tailwind for styling
🔹 golang for the backend (in different repository)
```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

In order to run this application you will need to have the following:

```text
🔸 VS code installed
🔸 node installed
🔸 npm installed
🔸 http-server installed
```

## 🐾 Step One

Change your directory to where you wish to run this script and store the cloned repository:

```bash
cd <filename>
```

## 🐾 Step Two

Clone the repository from github and then move into the new directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laurawarren88/spa_frontend.git
cd spa_frontend
```

## 🐾 Step Three

Take a look 👀 around the file 📂 structure and see what is happening with VS code.

```bash
code .
```

## 🐾 Step Four

You do not have to build or change anything (you can if you want).

All you need to do to run the application is type the following into the terminal:

```bash
http-server -p <port number>
```

This will run the application on your desired port. You can then access the application by going to:

```text
http://localhost:<port number> in your browser.
```

From here you will see the website and be able to interact with it.

However, you wont be able to do much unless you have the backend running.

To run the backend you will need to go to the following repository:

```text
https://github.com/laurawarren88/spa_backend
```

Follow the instructions in the README.md file to run the backend. If you change the backend port or aren't running on localhost ensure you change the config.js file in this repository -utils/config.js.
